# gd50-Breakout

This is an assignment for Harvard's GD50 course, which is a free online course that teaches basic game development.
This assignment had me implement certain features such as a powerup system, different paddle sizes, as well as
implementing locked blocks into a remake of the classic game Breaakout. This is some of my very first experience
I ever had with developing games and learning the very basic fundamentals. Archived as of 02/16/2021.
